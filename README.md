# Super-Mario-RL-Agent


In this project we trained a Super Mario Agent to complete a level of Super Mario world. We studied different Deep Q net architectures and found that Double DQN greatly outperformed the rest. The implementation of the Double DQN is above with a report to explain our ideas, process, and findings.
